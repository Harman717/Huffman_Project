# **Huffman_Project (DOSE - DAA On Steroids)**  

## 📌 **Inspiration**  
I created Huffman_Project to provide an interactive and educational tool for visualizing Huffman Coding and the Optimal Merge Pattern problem. These algorithms play a crucial role in data compression and file merging. My goal was to make learning these concepts engaging through dynamic visual explanations.

## 🛠️ **How I Built It**  

- **Frontend:** Developed using HTML and CSS for structure and styling.  
- **Backend Logic:** Implemented using JavaScript with object-oriented programming (OOP). Custom classes like `CustNode`, `List`, and `TreeUtil` handle tasks such as sorting nodes, generating trees, and creating SVG-based visualizations.  
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Applied a greedy approach for Huffman Coding and Optimal Merge Pattern, enabling efficient node creation and merging.  
- **Visualization Engine:** Used SVG elements to render trees and forests dynamically.
